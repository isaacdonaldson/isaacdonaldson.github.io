            <p>
                Welcome to my website, my name is Isaac Donaldson.
                I am a programmer and I enjoy writing software, and doing anything that interacts with it.
                In my free time I am usually reading, watching TV or playing video games (not in that order).
                If you have any questions feel free to reach out!

    <div id="article2">
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>I have a dedicated page to all the projects I deem are worthy enough to put on display. Most projects
                will not make their way onto the page, but some might.</p>
            <p>Look at my project page here:
                <a href="/projects.html">[PROJECTS]</a>
            </p>

    <div id="article2">
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Programs</h1>
            <p>Programs have a much lower barrier to posting then projects, and becuase I already have a page for
                projects, here is one for programs.
                In the future I plan to add some tools will be available to this site, but not yet.

            <h1>Articles</h1>
            <p>I currently have no articles written, but I might make write some in the future. If I ever feel like
                writing an opinionated article about an opinionated topic in programming (which appears to be endless),
                or a guide on the unfriendly world of programming, then this is where they will land.</p>

            <h1>Languages & Technologies</h1>
            <p>
                In my career so far, I have had the opportunity to work with some cool technologies. I have also played
                with quite a few languages and frameworks in my free time, which can be seen on the linked page.
