                <h1>about me</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my website, my name is Isaac Donaldson. I am a programmer and I enjoy writing software, and doing anything that interacts with it. In my free time I am usually reading, watching TV or playing video games (not in that order). Enjoy the website and wander around a bit, you're in no rush.</p>

                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>I have a dedicated page to all the projects I deem are worthy enough to put on display. Most projects will not make their way onto the page, but some might.</p>
                <p>Look at my project page here:
                    <a href="/projects.html">[PROJECTS]</a>
                </p>

                <h1>Programs</h1>
                <p>The difference between projects and problems as I see it is programs are like functions, take input, perform action, provide output. Projects are a more polished product, and use many programs working in concert to deliver value. Becuase I already have a page for projects, here is one for programs. In the future I plan to add some tools that can be used as REST calls to this site, but not yet. The barrier to me posting programs is much lower, so don't expect the world from me.</p>

                <h1>Articles</h1>
                <p>I currently have no articles written, but I might make write some in the future. If I ever feel like writing an opinionated article about an opinionated topic in programming (which appears to be endless), or a guide on the unfriendly world of programming, then this is where they will land.</p>

                <p>I have not had very much experience as a programmer, and I will be the first to make that claim. In my short (for now) career I have had the opportunity to work with some cool technologies, and they will be showcased on the linked page.</p>
