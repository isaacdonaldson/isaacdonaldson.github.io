                <p>I have been an athlete for the majority of my life. I have played a plethora of sports, from sports that every young Canadian plays (Soccer, Lacrosse and especially Hockey) to a more niche sport like Rowing. My Mom was a rower for the University of Victoria and so was my Brother. I had the priviledge to row with my brother at UVic for his last 2 years. This is a collection of acheivements and photos from my Rowing career. </p>
