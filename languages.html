            <p>While building a cloud native, serverless web application I have gotten experience using the following
                AWS services:</p>
            <p>Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, Amplify, S3, DocumentDB, CloudFront and a couple more not worth mentioning

            <p>My introduction into the frontend frameworks was in Vue, and I found it a joy to use. I have not used
                React for anything substantial, and I do admit to having an afinity for Svelte.</p>

            <h1>Clojure</h1>
            <p>
                Within a couple months of starting at Track49 (where I am currently employed) I was introcuded to Clojure. 
                After the initially shell shock of the sheer number of parenthesis, I found myself enjoying writing clojure quite a bit. 
                I find it a lot easier to write code when it is enjoyable, and that is why I still have Clojure as one of my favorite languages.
                It also helps that I have production code that just works.

            <h1>Rust</h1>
            <p>
                I bought into the hype of Rust and decided to learn it. After a couple months of on and off learning, I have reached a point where I can write code, but not idiomatic Rust.
                I still struggle with changing my way of thinking in terms of lifetimes and ownership. But if I were to daily drive it I am sure it would be a lot easier.

            <h1>Nim</h1>
            <p>
                Nim is not a language many people have heard of, and I think it's a shame. Nim is by far the easiest compiled and statically typed language to learn that I have found. 
                It is quite elegant in its expressiveness, and just behaves like a programmer would expect.
                It is a young language like Crystal, but is also on the bleeding edge of integrating technology into its compiler, like its new runtime memory management system.
                It really makes programming fun and interesting.
