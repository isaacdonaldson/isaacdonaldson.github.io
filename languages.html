            <h1>AWS</h1>
            <p>While building a cloud native, serverless web application I have gotten experience using the following
                AWS services:</p>
            <p>Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, Amplify, S3, DocumentDB, CloudFront and a couple more...

            <h1>Vue, JS, and the Frontend</h1>
            <p>My introduction into the frontend frameworks was in Vue, and I found it a joy to use. 
                Since then I have done some smaller scale projects in React, and I have done a couple things using Svelte.
                I do admit to enjoying Svelte and Vue quite a bit.</p>

            <h1>Clojure</h1>
            <p>
                Within a couple months of starting at Track49 I was introcuded to Clojure. 
                After the initially shell shock about the number of parenthesis, I found myself enjoying writing clojure quite a bit. 
                Writing code in Clojure is fun, and that makes everything else easier.
                Clojure is still one of my favorite languages, and it also helps that I have production code that just works in it.

            <h1>Rust</h1>
            <p>
                I bought into the hype of Rust and decided to learn it. After a couple months of on and off learning, I finally had the determination to jump in and actually commit to learning it.
                I think that there is enough Rust evangelism out there that I don't need to add to it, but I will say that I have enjoyed learning it, and look forward to using it more.

            <h1>Nim</h1>
            <p>
                Nim is not a language many people have heard of, and I think it's a shame. Nim is by far the easiest compiled and statically typed language to learn that I have found. 
                It is quite elegant in its expressiveness, and just behaves like a programmer would expect.
                It is a lesser known language, but has deploying novel ideas and in new ways for longer than most know.
                It really makes programming fun and interesting.
